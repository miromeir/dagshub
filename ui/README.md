For concept let's use figma.
I used the color pallete of stipe.com/jobs.
div style, border radius, shadow.
progress bar - use same rounded style
Surprise! their font cost money. we'll use something else.

To save efforts with css effects we'll use material ui.

Web server:
- 2 endpoints: 1 that accepts an integer in range 1-999. adds to total sum.
               1 that shows total amount of donation so far

What i would have done if i had more time:
Cleanup react code so that there are less inline styles.
Fetch the total donation amount from root endpoint and connect the progress bar to it.
CSS to make it look like my figma design.
